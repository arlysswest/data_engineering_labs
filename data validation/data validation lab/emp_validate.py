#2.Existance Assertion
#Assertion: every record has a non-null name field
#Write a python program called emp_validate.py (or something similar) that validates this assertion. The program should just count rows that do not satisfy this assertion. No need to modify or delete the invalid records. 
#How many records violate this assertion?
#Define a new, different Existence Assertion

#3. Limit Assertion
#assertion: every employee was hired no earlier than 2015
#Add code to your program to validate this assertion 
#How many records violate this assertion?
#Define a new, different Limit Assertion

#4. Intra-record Assertion
#Assertion: each employee was born before they were hired
#Add code to your program to validate this assertion
#How many records violate this assertion?
#Define a new, different Intra-record Assertion

#6. Summary Assertion
#Assertion: each city has more than one employee
#Add code to your program to validate this assertion
#Is the data set valid with respect to this assertion? 
#Define a new, different Summary Assertion

#7. Statistical Assertion
#Assertion: the salaries are normally distributed
#Add code to your program to validate this assertion
#Is the data set valid with respect to this assertion? For this show a screenshot of a histogram of salaries and state whether the histogram appears to resemble a normal distribution.
#Define a new, different Statistical Assertion
